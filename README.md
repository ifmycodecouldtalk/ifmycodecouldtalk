# Welcome!!

Hi, welcome to my GitHub. I will try to add code and contribute as much as possible whenever I can :)

# Current Goals
I'm currently trying to demonstrate my practicing on my GitHub. I've spent a lot of time learning my material, and now I feel confident in populating my GitHub profile with code to demonstrate my learning process. In here you will find:
* React Project where I add new features I learn about JavaScript and React
* ASP.NET project where I hone in on back-end topics using the ASP.NET Core library
* C++ or C# Code when I feel burnt out on other languages
* Java Code when I want to do challenges or practice interview questions
